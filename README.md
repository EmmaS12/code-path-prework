I'd like to build an app that helps me when I crochet. I would like to have a counter that keeps track of my stitch count and row count. I'd also like to have a library where I can keep track of my current and past projects. I'd like to have all the yarn information I used for those projects and crochet hook size I used.

I had some trouble finding where things were in Xcode but the videos provided were very helpful.
